## Write a short comment describing this function
## The function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix",
## which is really a list containing a function to
##   1. set the value of the matrix.
##   2. get the value of the matrix.
##   3. set the value of the solve.
##   4. get the value of the solve.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  ## begins by setting the solve to NULL as a placeholder for
  ## a future value.
  s <- NULL
  
  ## set the value of the matrix.
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    s <<- NULL
  }
  
  ## get the value of the matrix.
  get <- function() x
  
  ## set the value of the solve.
  setsolve <- function(solve) s <<- solve
  
  ## get the value of the solve.
  getsolve <- function() s
  
  ## returns the 'special matrix' containing all of the functions
  ## just defined.
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setsolve = setsolve,
       getsolve = getsolve)
}


## Write a short comment describing this function
## These part or code check if you have the solve of the matrix of
## interest. If these exist then you don't need calculate and you
## can use the cache variable.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'.
  
  ## it calls the getsolve() function on the input object.
  s <- x$getsolve()
  
  
  if(!is.null(s)) {
    ## if the value here is not equal to NULL, we have a valid,
    ## cached solve and can return it to the parent environment.
    message("getting cached data")
    return(s)
  }
  
  ## If the result of !is.null(s) is FALSE, cacheSolve() gets the
  ## matrix from the input object, calculates a solve(), uses the
  ## setsolve() function on the input object to set the solve in
  ## the input object, and then returns the value of the solve to
  ## the parent environment by printing the solve object.
  data <- x$get()
  s <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setsolve(s)
  s
}
